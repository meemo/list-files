# list-files
A python script that outputs the full paths to all files within a given directory and exports it to a text file, similar to the windows command `dir /s /b > output.txt`. This script, however, does not create additional newlines when it encounters certain symbols and can be used on any OS with python installed.

Usage:

`listFiles.py [directory] [output_file.txt]`
